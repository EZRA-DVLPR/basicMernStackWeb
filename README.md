# Comp680FSWeb

File Sharing Website

# Description

## Project Description

This project is designed to be a File Sharing Website (FSWeb) that allows users to:
- upload documents to an online storage
- we intend to add compression options based on the file type being uploaded
- download documents from the same online storage (we will be decompressing the data upon download request)

> [!Note]
> The data uploaded is visible by ANY authenticated user.
> This is not a private data storage service.

## Tech Stack

We are utilizing the MERN stack:

- MongoDB for the database
- Express.JS for the backend
- React.JS for the frontend
- Node.JS for the backend

We additionally hope to utilize the cloud for storing the data.

A future development is to make the website serverless (hosted on the cloud).

## API Functionality

- Google Authentication
